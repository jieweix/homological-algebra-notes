Lecture notes for MATH70063 Algebra 4 at Imperial College London, 2024/25.

The notes are finished but not necessarily free from errors.

The in-house name of this module is "Algebra 4", which tells you nothing about what it's about, so I called this repository a more approriate name; the module is an introduction to homological algebra, comprising some basic category theory, study of R-modules through their complexes, resolutions, derived functors, Ext and Tor, ending with the inflation-restriction sequence and the Lyndon–Hochschild–Serre spectral sequence.
